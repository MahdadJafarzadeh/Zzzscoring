This is a package for automatic sleep scoring. The package is based on [ssccoorriinngg](https://https://github.com/MahdadJafarzadeh/ssccoorriinngg) and in principle provides the same functionality but as a graphical user interface (GUI).

Please Note: The current version is alpha and still under development.
